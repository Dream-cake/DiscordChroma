# DiscordChroma
a windows app that enables discord events to trigger razer chroma lighting on supported devices

Note: "selfbot's" (which is used here for connecting to discord) are against Discord their ToS,
there is a very small change that you get banned.
BUT thats not very likely because it only listens for events and doesn't do anything else in discord it self.
and my app would fall outside of their statement here Discord Support page,
judge for your self.
You have been warned.
